This is a repository containing solutions of [CodingBat](www.codingbat.com) problems in Python. 

I was starting out in Python and decided to do these problems so as to get acquainted with the syntax, and to get a handle on the basic data structures in Python.

The files contain only the solutions, named according to the problem name. You can view the problem statements on [CodingBat](www.codingbat.com/python).
